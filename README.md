# LCA
Stoichiometry-based calculations for evlauate net energy, green house gas production, and operation costs of the recycling process.


Hi everyone. 
This is an Excel-based, purpose-based LCA toll. 
The system's net energy, CO2 emissions, and operating costs were calculated when PLA and food waste were mixed and recycled 
under various scenarios (thermal, physical, chemical, and anaerobic digestion; anaerobic digestion was primarily used for food waste).

- Please refer to the figure below for the scenarios.
